    <h1>5 Vaping Facts You Need to Know</h1>
    <div>
      <p>
        If you have thought about trying to kick a smoking habit, you’re not
        alone. Nearly 7 of 10 smokers say they want to stop. Quitting smoking is
        one of the best things you can do for your health smoking harms nearly
        every organ in your body, including your heart. Nearly one-third of
        deaths from heart disease are the result of smoking and secondhand smoke
      </p>
      <p>
        You might be tempted to turn to electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes,
        vape pens, and other nondisposable and disposable vaping devices) as a
        way to ease the transition from traditional cigarettes to not smoking at
        all.
      </p>
      <p>
        But is smoking e-cigarettes (also called vaping) better for you than
        using tobacco products? Can e-cigarettes help you to stop smoking once
        for all? Michael Blaha, M.D., M.P.H., director of clinical research at
        the Johns Hopkins Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart Disease,
        shares health information about vaping.

    <h2>1: Vaping is less harmful than smoking, but it’s still not safe.</h2>
    <div>
      <p>
        E-cigarettes heat nicotine (extracted from tobacco), flavorings and
        other chemicals to create an aerosol that you inhale. Regular tobacco
        cigarettes contain 7,000 chemicals, many of which are toxic. While we
        don’t know exactly what chemicals are in e-cigarettes, Blaha says
        “There’s almost no doubt that vaping exposes you to fewer toxic
        chemicals than smoking traditional cigarettes.”
      </p>
      <p>
        However, there has been an outbreak of lung injuries and associated with
        vaping. In February 2020, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
        (CDC) confirmed 2,807 cases of e-cigarette or vaping use-associated lung
        injury (EVALI) and 68 deaths attributed to that condition
      </p>
      <p>
        “These cases appear to predominantly affect people who modify their
        vaping devices or use black market modified e-liquids. This is
        especially true for vaping products containing THC,” explains Blaha.

    <h3>2: Research suggests vaping is bad for your heart and lungs.</h3>
    <div>
      <p>
        Nicotine is the primary agent in regular cigarettes and e-cigarettes,
        and it is highly addictive. It causes you to crave a smoke and suffer
        withdrawal symptoms if you ignore the craving. Nicotine is a toxic
        substance. It raises your blood pressure and spikes your adrenaline,
        which increases your heart rate and the likelihood of having a heart
        attack.
      </p>
      <p>
        Is vaping bad for you? There are many unknowns about vaping, including
        what chemicals make up the vapor and how they affect physical health
        over the long term. “People need to understand that e-cigarettes are
        potentially dangerous to your health,” says Blaha.
      </p>
      <p>
        “Emerging data suggests links to chronic lung disease and asthma, as
        well as associations between dual use of e-cigarettes and smoking with
        cardiovascular disease. You’re exposing yourself to all kinds of
        chemicals that we don’t yet understand and that are probably not safe.”
      </p>
    </div>
    <h4>3: Electronic cigarettes are just as addictive as traditional ones.</h4>
    <div>
      <p>
        Both e-cigarettes and regular cigarettes contain nicotine, which
        research suggests may be as addictive as heroin and cocaine.
      </p>
      <p>
        What’s worse, says Blaha, many e-cigarette users get even more nicotine
        than they would from a combustible tobacco product:
      </p>
      <p>
        Users can buy extra-strength cartridges, which have a higher
        concentration of nicotine, or increase the e-cigarette’s voltage to get
        a greater hit of the substance.
      </p>
    </div>
    <h5>4: Electronic cigarettes aren’t the best smoking cessation tool.</h5>
    <div>
      <p>
        Although they’ve been promoted as an aid to help you quit smoking,
        e-cigarettes have not received Food and Drug Administration approval as
        smoking cessation devices.
      </p>
      <p>
        A recent study found that most people who intended to use e-cigarettes
        to kick the nicotine habit ended up continuing to use traditional and
        e-cigarettes.
      </p>
      <p>
        In light of the EVALI outbreak, the CDC advises people who use
        e-cigarettes for smoking cessation to weigh the risks and benefits and
        first consider use of other FDA-approved smoking cessation options.

    <h6>5: A new generation is getting hooked on nicotine.</h6>
    <div>
      <p>
        Among youth, e-cigarettes, especially the disposable kind, are more
        popular than any traditional tobacco product. According to the 2021
        National Youth Tobacco Survey, more than 2 million U.S. middle and high
        school students reported using e-cigarettes in 2021, with more than 8 in
        10 of those youth using flavored e-cigarettes.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to Blaha, there are three reasons e-cigarettes may be
        particularly enticing to young people. First, many teens believe vaping
        is less harmful than smoking. Second, e-cigarettes have a lower per-use
        cost than traditional cigarettes. Finally, youths and adults find the
        lack of smoke appealing. With no smell, e-cigarettes reduce some of the
        stigma of smoking.
      </p>
      <p>
        “What I find most concerning about the rise of vaping is that people who
        would’ve never smoked otherwise, especially youth, are taking up the
        habit,” says Blaha. “It’s one thing if you convert from cigarette
        smoking to vaping. It’s quite another thing to start up nicotine use
        with vaping. And, getting hooked on nicotine often leads to using
        traditional tobacco products down the road.”
